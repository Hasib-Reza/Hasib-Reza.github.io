  <h1> Hasib Reza </h1>

  <h2> Dhaka, Bangladesh </h2>

  <p> I am a Law Student currently in my Second Year at the University of London external programs. I am also learning to code in my free time so that I may learn a valuable, technical 'hard' skill as well as make some extra pocket money on the side to prove to my dear mom that I am not completely useless

    <h2> Education </h2>
    <ol>
    <li> iGCSEs at the British School of Guangzhou, China </li>
    <li> A-levels also at the British School of Guangzhou, China. There, I studied, History, Psychology, and Business Studies </li>
  </ol>
    <h2> Work Experience </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> I did a mini-internship at Wragge and Co, as well as the Law firm Rouse, in their offices in Guangzhou, where I mostly pretended to work on a computer they trusted me with, as well as drank copious amounts of their coffee and tea. All in all, I learned a lot </li>
        <li> Volunteered at the Habitat for Humanity, where I passed bricks along a brick chain (where I felt my life's true calling) as well as helped local farmers pick oranges, eating my fair share of the fruits as payment </li>
        <li> On UpWork, completed 2 small writing related jobs, one of which involved rewriting a college student's essay </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Guy I recently discovered, I probably will have a jawline like him if I can actually follow through with my diet, and not cheat on it everytime I see suggary, curvy, cakes </p>

    <p> First time I felt a song bring something out from inside of me, or touch me inside </p>
